# ***Question 1 ***
An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user
account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security
database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.
The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges.

# ***Question 4 ***
A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code,
to help you do things more quickly/easily.A library is a collection of functions / objects
that serves one particular purpose. You could use a library in a variety of projects.
For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for loading and manipulating bitmap images,
saving you having to write all that code for yourself.Typically a library will
only offer one area of functionality.

An API (application programming interface) is a term meaning the functions/methods
in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you - the interface to the library.APIs are
used to connect an application with external code.

Example :- Angular js- a JS framework may use many libraries like iniline editing of text using an exposed API of that library.
